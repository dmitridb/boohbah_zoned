# boohbah_zoned

This is a program I wrote some years ago because this guy at this
hostel I had been staying at was looking at full on transsexual porn
on the public computers in there and he didn't stop when we were like
"dude what the fuck, stop doing that". It basically redirects all porn
to a super whacked out flash game written for babies called:

# THE BOOHBAH ZONE ( Can be viewed here: http://209.250.255.198 )

It was super funny, he actually came up to me and asked if porn was
blocked on easter weekend which gave me an excellent opportunity to
tell him to fuck off with that shit. Soon after he got kicked out
of the hostel to go be a deadbeat somewhere else, but since he treated
public computers like they were his own, he'd leave his facebook acct
logged in all the time. So of course, someone takes advantage of this
and changed his facebook status to something rude about big black dicks.
Of course he figures I'm the one who did this and he wrote a big stupid
email to me saying shit like "you are the hacker between all those dopeheads
and drunks" and threatening "captain mario" from the local police to get
in on it. You can read that for a chuckle here:

Anyways I recently rewrote this because the same hostel was having this
issue with losers who completely lack a sense of discretion looking at porn
on those computers again. Story time done, I strongly encourage anyone
who wants to fuck with this kind of idiot to download my code and try it out!

Written for python 3. The fuck you people still using py2 for? This will
likely be the only code you see from me on microsoft githubÂ®
